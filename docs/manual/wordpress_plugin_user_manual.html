				<h2>CPD Search Users guide</h2>
				<hr/>
				<p>
					Brief instructions on how to use the CPD search plugin.
				</p>
				<p>
					The cpd search plugin enables 'commercial property agents' to provide a search feature on their wordpress website. Agents can choose to display a search of ONLY their own properties ('current instructions') or a full search of our entire database.
				</p>
				<p>
					This user guide will show how to:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Search for commercial properties</li>
					<li>View results</li>
					<li>Add properties to a shortlist</li>
					<li>Register interest in those properties</li>
					<li>Verify a user</li>
					<li>Download shortlist</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="itemcontainer">
				<h2>Search form</h2>
				<hr/>
				<p>
					The first screen a user will usually see is the 'search form'. Currently there are two options:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Selected properties</li>
					<li>Full Search Form</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<b>Selected properties</b> is a basic dropdown which will show a list of the 'property types' which the agent has properties available in. Simply select the type from the list and the results page will load.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Full search</b> is a form with multiple inputs to filter results:</p>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Sector - eg offices, industrial warehouses</li>
					<li>Tenure - Leasehold, Freehold or both</li>
					<li>Area - These are CPD defined areas</li>
					<li>Location - Add your own location</li>
					<li>Postcode</li>
					<li>Size</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Simply fill out the form or just click "search now" for a full search</b>

				<h2>Results view</h2>
				<hr/>
				<p>
					This is a basic list of matching properties that displays some of the main details about each property.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each property should have an <b>'add to shortlist'</b> button which when clicked will add that property to the users shortlist.
				</p>
				<p>
					Usually the shortlist should be visible in the results view and the user goes through and adds as many properties as they wish.

			<div class="itemcontainer">
				<p><h2>View / download Shortlist</h2></p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Once the user is happy that they have added all the desired properties to their shortlist just click the 'download shortlist' link. To be able to see the full details of the properties the user will then be taken to a 'register user' form..</p>
				</p>

				<h2>Register user contact details</h2>
				<hr/>
				<p>
					This step is a basic form where the user should enter their contact details to be able to receive the downlooad of the shortlist and so the 'agent' can contact them about the properties they have added to the shortlist.
				</p>
				<p>
					After the form is submitted the user will get a verification email.
				</p>

			</div>
			<div class="itemcontainer">
				<h2>View / Email shortlist</h2>
				<hr/>
				<p>
					After contact details have been sent the 'shortlist' page will show. Here the user can choose to 'email list' or continue to search and add / remove more properties.
				</p>
				<p>
					To receive the email the user will need to 'verify' their email address.
				</p>

			<div class="itemcontainer">
				<h2>Verify user</h2>
				<hr/>
				<p>
					User will be sent an email so that they can verify their email address. Just click the link in the email and the user will be taken to a verification success page. Once the email address is verified user will receive another email with the full property details.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="itemcontainer">
				<h2>Agent contact email</h2>
				<hr/>
				<p>
					The website agent will also get an email notifying them that you the user has 'registered interest' in a property or properties.
